The current draft specification is based on the PT 1.0 specification and the Pluggable Transports Work in Progress. It also contains the Pluggable Transports Go API and Pluggable Transport UDP Support. Additionally, it includes feedback from the workshop on those proposals.

The Tor Project authored the [original Pluggable Transports specification](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/pt-spec.txt) for use in the tor network environment.

In 2015 and 2016, a series of meetings of current transport developers and implementers circumvention tools met to determine broader, community requirements on what would be useful in a revised Pluggable Transports specification. These led to three proposals:

* [Pluggable Transports Go API](/assets/PluggableTransportsGoAPI.pdf)
* [Pluggable Transport UDP Support Proposal](/assets/PluggableTransportUDPSupport.pdf)
* [Pluggable Transports Work In Progress](/assets/PluggableTransportsWorkInProgress.pdf)

Based on community feedback from these proposals, they were merged in to a new draft specification:
[Pluggable Transports Specification, Version 2, Draft 1.](/spec/pt2draft1)
